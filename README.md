# cisnlp/oscar-io
Types and IO (Reader/Writer) for GlotCC/OSCAR Corpus processing and generation.

The crate provides basic abstractions around Corpus items and generic readers/writers useable in GlotCC/OSCAR Corpus files.
At some time, it should replace reader implementations in both [cisnlp/Ungoliant](https://github.com/cisnlp/Ungoliant) and [cisnlp/oscar-tools](https://github.com/cisnlp/oscar-tools).


## Features

`cisnlp/oscar-io` aims to provide readers/writers for numerous types of GlotCC/OSCAR Corpora.
