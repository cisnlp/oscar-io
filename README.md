# oscar-io
Types and IO (Reader/Writer) for OSCAR Corpus processing and generation.

The crate provides basic abstractions around Corpus items and generic readers/writers useable in OSCAR Corpus files.
At some time, it should replace reader implementations in both [Ungoliant](https://github.com/oscar-corpus/Ungoliant) and [oscar-tools](https://github.com/oscar-corpus/oscar-tools).
